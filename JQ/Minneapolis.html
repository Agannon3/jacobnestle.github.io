  It was here where Andrew Cunanan began his killing spree. He flew out from Los <br>
  <br>
  Angeles to visit his friends Jeffrey Trail and David Madson. At David Madsonâ€™s <BR>
    <br>
   apartment on April 27th, 1997, Cunanan murdered Trail out of jealousy. Investigators <BR>
    <BR>
   believe Cunanan did not like how close Trail was to Madson. Madson <BR>
    <br>
   and Cunanan were seen walking around the apartment building and Minneapolis. <br>
   <br>
   Cunanan called Madson the love of his life and told others he wanted to marry him. <BR>
    <br>
   Trail was probably seen as a threat to Cunanan's relationship with Madson and he wanted to eliminate him. <BR>
