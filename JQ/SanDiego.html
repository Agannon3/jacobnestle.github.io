    Andrew Cunanan was born in San Diego, California in 1969 to a Filipino father and <br>
    <BR>
    Italian-American mother. Andrew’s family came from modest beginnings but when Andrew’s <br>
    <BR>
    father Modesto got a job at Merrill Lynch, a lot changed for the Cunanan family. They moved <br>
    <BR>
    into a larger house in a more affluent neighborhood and Modesto bought Andrew a <br>
    <BR>
    Mercedes...when he was fourteen. Andrew was admitted to the Bishop’s school after an IQ test <br>

    <BR>
    <center>
    showed an IQ of 147. Andrew was known to tell fantastical lies to his friends at Bishop's, often <br>
    <BR>
    saying he was the son of extremely wealthy people or royal families. In his late high school years, <br>
    <BR>
    Cunanan had liaisons with older, wealthy gay men. Cunanan often claimed he was friends with <br>
    <BR>
    celebrities, specifically Versace. Cunanan attended UC San Diego for a year but soon quit. After <br>
    <BR>
    this, he lived with his mother in a small apartment in San Diego and worked at a pharmacy. He <br>

    soon began a relationship with Norman Blanchford. Norman was a multi-millionaire businessman who <br>
    <BR>
    recently lost his longtime partner of twenty-five years to AIDS. <br>
    <BR>
    Before Blanchford, Cunanan did not have access to the high <br>
    <BR>
    class lifestyle. Blanchford gave Cunanan 2,500 a month, a 9000 square <br>
    <BR>
    foot La Jolla house, and a new car. The two lived together in this house <br>
    <BR>
    and enjoyed going to Operas and artistic events. They took a vacation to <br>
    </center>

    <BR>
    <center>
    Europe where they went to the French Riviera and Venice. This was a <br>
    <BR>
    glamorous lifestyle for Cunanan that did not end well. Cunanan demanded <br>
    <BR>
    Blanchford give him free first class international and domestic flights, a <br>
    <BR>
    Mercedes SL 600, and an increased allowance or else he would leave. <br>
    <BR>
    Blanchford declined the ultimatum and Cunanan’s lifestyle began to <br>
    <BR>
    deeply regress. <br>
