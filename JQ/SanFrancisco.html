  Cunanan dropped out of UC San Diego and moved to the Castro district. <br>
  <br>
  He lived with his high school best friend Elizabeth Cotes and her husband Phil Merrill. <br>
  <br>
  Interestingly, Phil Merrill told investigators that Cunanan once told him “If I got AIDS, <BR>
    <br>
  I would go on a five state killing spree to find the person who gave me AIDS” if Cunanan <br>
  <BR>
  ever got the disease. Because of the time and <br>

  the circumstances, Investigators believed that Cunanan was indeed HIV positive and that his <br>
  <br>
  motive was to try and murder people who gave him the disease. The coroner found Cunanan to <br>
  <br>
   be HIV negative. In San Francisco, Cunanan dealt opiates, cocaine, marijuana and <br>
   <br>
   methamphetamine. He was able to support himself by creating a wide social circle of wealthy <br>
   <br>
   older male friends. Cunanan met many of these men through his work as a male sex worker. <br>
   <br>
   According to sources within the early 90s San Fran nightlife scene, Cunanan met Versace <br>
   <br>
   at the nightclub Collasus. The Versace family denies any meeting took place but Cunanan <br>
   <br>
   did tell his friends he met Versace. <BR>
