  When Cunanan arrived in Miami, he checked into the Normandy Hotel with a fake <br>
  <br>
  passport. Miriam Hernandez, the hotel manager, noted Cunanan’s good looks and manners, “He <BR>
    <br>
  was a very good guest, he had a beautiful smile.” It was here Cunanan stayed for approximately <BR>
    <br>
  three weeks before murdering Gianni Versace. On July 7th Cunanan pawned one of Lee Miglin’s <BR>
    <br>
  gold coins at a pawnshop despite knowing that the police regularly check pawn shop records. <BR>
    <br>
  Versace was a well know celebrity in the Miami area. He had a good rapport with the community <BR>
    <br>
  and was commonly seen walking around South Beach. On the morning of July 15, 1997 after <BR>
    <br>
  doing his traditional morning walk Versace was shot by Cunanan. The position of the body <BR>
    <br>
  indicated that Versace probably saw his killer. Witnesses say that after murdering Versace, <BR>
    <br>
  Cunanan casually walked away like nothing happened. A house worker from Versace’s mansion <BR>
    <br>
  soon chased Cunanan down an alley where Cunanan ultimately pointed his gun at him <BR>
    <br>
  and demanded him to stop. A manhunt for Cunanan began in Miami Beach as traffic to the city was <BR>
    <br>
  cut off and the island was sealed off to outsiders. Authorities soon pinned down Cunanan to an <BR>
    <br>
  old Miami houseboat, where a standoff took place for approximately eight hours. Police finally <BR>
    <br>
  entered the boat to find Cunanan dead. Cunanan’s cause of death was suicide by a self inflicted <BR>
    <br>
   shot to the head. He left no suicide note. <BR>
