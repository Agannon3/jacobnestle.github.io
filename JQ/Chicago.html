  Lee Miglin was Cunanan’s third victim. <br>
  <BR>
  This murder occured on May 4th, a day after Madson’s body was found. <br>
  <BR>
  Miglin was tortured to death and killed while his wife was out of town. <br>
  <BR>
  His body was discovered underneath a car in his garage with gay pornographic magazines surrounded the body. <br>
  <BR>
  A large ham was discovered on Lee Miglin’s desk. There were no signs of forced entry and police speculate <br>
  <BR>
  that Lee perhaps knew or acquiesced to Cunanan. Cunanan had stayed the night after murdering Miglin and <br>
  <BR>
  even shaved and showered. Many experts believe that Lee knew Cunanan and possibly hired him as an escort. <br>
  <BR>
  The Miglin family firmly denies that the two ever knew each other but many questions remain. Why would <br>
  <BR>
  Cunanan stay in someone’s house if he did not know anyone else in the family was going to be there? <br>
  <BR>
  Why would he go to the house of an extremely wealthy person who he did not know? Why would Cunanan <br>
  <BR>
  simply only murder Lee to take his Lexus? Out of all Cunanan’s murders the motive for this one is <br>
  <BR>
  by far the most ambiguous. There are many questions and few answers. It is reasonable to believe <br>
  <BR>
  that there is a deeper meaning to this. Was Cunanan destroying the reputation and life of a closeted <br>
  <BR>
  gay man as a means to gain revenge on a society that he felt rejected by? <br>
