    <h1>WHERE TO GO</h1>
    <p>I spend a lot of my daydream time reading travel guides and looking at random places on Google Maps to see where I might want to go in the future.</p>
    <p>The future travel (and money) situation aside, the places i'd want to travel to most include Slovenia, Japan, Chile, and Ireland.</p>
