        John Berger's <i>Ways of Seeing</i> provided an excellent bridge from historical classical art to modern society. As someone who has had no previous interest in such a topic, the concepts brought up by John Berger surprised me. The connections revealed have never crossed my mind once before viewing the episodes.

    <p>Berger references how the seemingly high class and unobtainable to most visuals of classical paintings were created in order to produce social envy. With social envy aimed towards those who do have the high class possessions and status, the glamour of such a life is sustained. Berger compares this factor of classical art to modern advertising.</p>

    <center><img src="Power.png" height="300" width="400" /></center>
    <p>Berger references the display of power throughout classical art. The intention behind the art is to showcase what wealth could accomplish and to show wealth and power as desirable and absolute.</p>
