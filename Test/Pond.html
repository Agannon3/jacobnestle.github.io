    <!--I used div IDs in order to define the individual elements on the page such as the individual fish and the textbox on the side. I figured this would give me the bext options for specific locating and positioning.
        However, I still ran into trouble trying to make the elements stay still when zooming in and out. Using percentage units like % and vw and vh made them move in a different way but still move from the pond.
        Changing the type of positioning each element had also did not change anything for the better. It is the one big thing that stumped me during this project.-->
